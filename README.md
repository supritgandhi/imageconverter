This is an image converter which converts .odg[open-document graphics] to .bmp files.
This program uses libxml.h library which is required to parse XML documents in it as, .odg stores it data or content in the form XML.
So far, this code only works for Geometrical shapes like a line i.e. a line segment which is either horizontal or vertical and squares and rectangles.
BMP file is made using arrays.
